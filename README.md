# 🌀 UniBlitz – Automate University Evaluations & Access Results Instantly

UniBlitz is a lightweight Chrome Extension designed specifically for `City University` students who are required to complete teacher and course evaluations before accessing their results. It automates the repetitive rating and comment process, letting you unlock your result page with a single click.

---

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ One-click auto-completion of evaluation forms  
- ✅ Automatically selects ratings and fills feedback  
- ✅ Works only on university evaluation pages  
- ✅ 100% local — no remote code, no data collection

## 🔧 How It Works

UniBlitz runs on specific university domains (e.g., `cu.edu.pk`). Once you open the evaluation page or click the extension popup, it:

1. Retrieves your saved rating/comment from storage
2. Fills all questions and comment fields
3. Lets you quickly submit and unlock your result page
